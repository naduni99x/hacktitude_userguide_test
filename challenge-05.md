Your task involves completing the codes in these following files:
`groupRepository.js`,`groupService.js`.

1. Implement a method called `getGroupsFromKeyword(keyword)` in the `groupService.js` file which will call a function of same name and parameter from `groupRepository.js` method and return an array containing the groups matching to the keyword provided from the frontend.

2. Implement a method called `addNewGroup(data)` in the `groupService.js` file which will call a function of same name and parameter from `groupRepository.js` method and return a status code of `200` as a success response when a new group is created successfully.

Expected object for `data` parameter:
```json
{
    group_name:"<GROUP NAME>",
    group_desc:"<GROUP DESCRIPTION>"
}
```


**HINT** 
-  When searching for groups using a keyword, you should consider what happens when the keyword returns an empty array. 
- When inserting a new group into the Groups table, it is useful if you return the new `Id` of the created group.
