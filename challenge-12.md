# Challenge 12 - Add new task to a project

The user can now click on the newly created project card and view the project details on the pop-up modal as shown below.

In this challenge your task is to implement the funtionaility to add a new task to the relevent project.

When the user clicks on the `Add Task +` button, the modal content will be changed and when the user enters the task details and clicks on the `Save` button, an alert will be displayed with a relevent message.

After the page reloads and upon clicking on the relevent project the newly added task will be displayed under the tasks list of that project.

To achieve this, you first have to implement the `addNewTask(taskDetails)` method inside the `groupRepository.js` file similar to the previous tasks but in this case the SQL query will be an INSERT query with all the details obtained in the `taskDetails` argument but in the order of the columns in the tasks table.

The Promise has to resolve a message saying `"success"` after successfully saving the task details in the tasks table in the database.

**Note** - Always cross check with the database tables whether the API calls work properly and the database has been updated. You can always run `knex run:seed` to get back to the default data in the database.
